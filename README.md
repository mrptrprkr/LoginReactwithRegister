# LoginReactwithRegister
This app.js is for login / register.

Within src, within components, there is a file called app.jsx. There is a line called: var userIsRegistered = true; If this is set for true, there are only username and password on the screen. If, this is set for false, there are username, password, confirm password, register. Watch out for the difference!
